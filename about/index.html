    <div id="biotext">
      <p>Born in Southern Illinois, I came to Nashville in the midst of COVID in 2020 to be in a space of more opportunities and abundance. Coming from a tiny town with a  population of 7,000, I felt out of place, lost in my identity and what my calling would be. I grew up feeling that I wasn’t good at anything I ever tried. Modeling, set designing, and styling has made me feel the most FREE I’ve ever felt in my life. This form of art feels so right with my soul. Creating art with my mind & physical body is such a blessing, I speak my gratitude daily. I pray that more people understand this feeling in their spirit. My excitement for this art form grows every day and I can’t wait to work with more creatives! Thank you for stopping in.</p>
      <p>Love, Bone Gracie </p>
